## Layer 1: Application-Level Column Encryption

### What is encrypted

| Model | Fields | Method |
|---|---|---|
| User | email, name | AES-256-GCM + HMAC-SHA256 hash |
| VendorContact | name, email, phone | AES-256-GCM + HMAC-SHA256 hash |
| AuditorAccount | email, name | AES-256-GCM + HMAC-SHA256 hash |
| NotificationOutbox | toEmail | AES-256-GCM |
| UserIdentityLink | emailAtLinkTime | AES-256-GCM + HMAC-SHA256 hash |

### How it works

- **Encryption**: Prisma middleware (`pii-middleware.ts`) intercepts `create`/`update` operations, encrypts PII fields into `*Encrypted` columns, and generates HMAC-SHA256 lookup hashes.
- **Decryption**: On `findMany`/`findUnique`, middleware transparently decrypts `*Encrypted` columns back into the original field names.
- **Lookup**: Email lookups use `emailHash` (HMAC-SHA256), not the ciphertext — so email-based login/linking works without decrypting every row.

### Key management

| Variable | Purpose | Generation | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Master key for AES-256-GCM + HMAC | `openssl rand -base64 48` | **Yes** in production. Boot exits 1 if missing, too short (<32 chars), or equal to the dev fallback. |
| `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` | Decrypt fallback during master-KEK rotation | `openssl rand -base64 48` | Optional. Set ONLY during a rotation; remove once the rotation job reports zero remaining v1 rows under the previous key. |

> [!CAUTION]
> Losing `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` means **permanent data loss** for all encrypted columns.
> Rotate responsibly — the backfill script re-encrypts existing data under a new key.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GAP-03 — production fail-fast.** Three independent checks refuse to
> start a production process without a valid key:
>
> 1. **Zod schema** (`src/env.ts`) — module-load validation rejects
>    missing, too-short, and dev-fallback values when `NODE_ENV=production`.
> 2. **Startup hook** — Next.js (`src/instrumentation.ts`), BullMQ worker
>    (`scripts/worker.ts`), and the deploy-time scheduler
>    (`scripts/scheduler.ts`) all run the same check + the web tier
>    additionally runs an encrypt → decrypt sentinel round-trip. Each
>    `process.exit(1)` with `[startup] FATAL: …` on failure.
> 3. **Compose** — every prod compose file (`docker-compose.prod.yml`,
>    `docker-compose.staging.yml`, `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`)
>    uses `${DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY:?…}` so `docker compose up` aborts
>    before the container is even created.
>
> Dev/test environments use the documented in-source fallback
> (`src/lib/security/encryption-constants.ts`) so contributors do not
> need to manage this var locally. The fallback string is published in
> source intentionally — its security property is "refused in prod",
> not "secret".

## Layer 2: Transport Encryption

| Path | Encryption |
|---|---|
| Client → App | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), enforced via `force_https` / reverse proxy |
| App → Database | `sslmode=require` for managed providers; local Docker uses internal network |
| App → S3/R2 | HTTPS (AWS SDK enforces TLS) |

### Docker Compose (self-hosted)

The database container is on an **internal bridge network** with no external port exposed. Traffic between the app and DB never leaves the Docker host. For additional transport security, configure `sslmode=require` in `DATABASE_URL` if the Postgres instance supports TLS.

---

## Layer 3: Storage-at-Rest Encryption

### Why NOT PostgreSQL TDE

PostgreSQL Transparent Data Encryption (pg_tde) is **not available** in the deployment stack:

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| EDB Postgres Extended | ❌ Not used — `postgres:16-alpine` is community edition |
| `pg_tde` contrib extension | ❌ Not included in `postgres:16-alpine` |
| Custom Postgres build | ❌ Not applicable for this project |

**Honest assessment**: True PostgreSQL TDE is not implementable without switching to EDB or building a custom Postgres image with the `pg_tde` extension. This would introduce significant maintenance burden for marginal benefit, since:
1. App-layer encryption already protects PII at the column level
2. Provider-managed disk encryption protects the full volume
3. TDE primarily protects against stolen disk — the same threat model covered by volume encryption

### Chosen posture: Provider-managed at-rest encryption + app-layer PII encryption

#### Railway (Managed Postgres)

| What | Encrypted | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Database storage | ✅ | Railway PostgreSQL plugin uses encrypted volumes (AWS EBS encryption, AES-256) |
| Database backups | ✅ | Railway automated backups are encrypted |
| File storage (S3/R2) | ✅ | S3: SSE-S3 (AES-256) by default; R2: encrypted at rest |
| Application secrets | ✅ | Railway environment variables are encrypted at rest |

**Verification**: Railway dashboard → PostgreSQL plugin → Volume details confirms encryption.

#### Fly.io (Managed Postgres)

| What | Encrypted | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Database storage | ✅ | Fly Postgres volumes use encrypted NVMe (host-level) |
| Database backups | ⚠️ | Manual; use `pg_dump | gpg -e` for encrypted backups |
| File storage (S3/R2) | ✅ | S3: SSE-S3 (AES-256) by default |
| Application secrets | ✅ | `fly secrets set` — encrypted at rest |

**Verification**: `fly volumes list` confirms volume encryption status.

#### Self-Hosted VPS / Docker Compose

| What | Encrypted | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Database storage | ⚠️ Operator responsibility | LUKS/dm-crypt on host partition |
| Database backups | ⚠️ Operator responsibility | GPG-encrypted `pg_dump` |
| File storage | ⚠️ Operator responsibility | Encrypted volume mount or S3 with SSE |
| Application secrets | ✅ | `.env.production` file permissions (0600) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Self-hosted deployments MUST use encrypted volumes** for the Docker data directory.
> Without this, database files and uploaded evidence are stored in plaintext on disk.

---

## Self-Hosted: Volume Encryption Guide

### Option A: LUKS full-disk encryption (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Create encrypted partition for Docker data
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX encrypted-data
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted-data
sudo mount /dev/mapper/encrypted-data /var/lib/docker

# 2. Configure Docker to use encrypted volume
# Docker data root is now on the LUKS partition
# All named volumes (pgdata, uploads) are encrypted at rest
```

### Option B: LUKS-encrypted Docker volumes

```bash
# Create encrypted volume for Postgres data
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdY
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdY pg-encrypted
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/pg-encrypted
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/encrypted-pgdata
sudo mount /dev/mapper/pg-encrypted /mnt/encrypted-pgdata
```

Then in `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  prod-pgdata:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: /mnt/encrypted-pgdata
      o: bind
```

## Backup Encryption

### Database backups

```bash
# Encrypted backup (GPG)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec db \
  pg_dump -U inflect inflect_production \
  | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 -o backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gpg

# Restore from encrypted backup
gpg -d backup_20260324.sql.gpg \
  | docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -i db \
  psql -U inflect inflect_production
```

### Upload/evidence backups

```bash
# Encrypted backup (tar + GPG)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app \
  tar czf - -C /data/uploads . \
  | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 -o uploads_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz.gpg
```

> [!WARNING]
> Unencrypted `pg_dump` output contains **all database contents including PII**.
> Always encrypt backups at rest. Never store unencrypted backups on unencrypted volumes.

## Secrets & Key Management

### Required secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Where to store |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | App-layer column encryption | Environment variable |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth session signing | Environment variable |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT token signing | Environment variable |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database authentication | Environment variable |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3/R2 authentication | Environment variable |
| `AV_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | AV scan webhook HMAC | Environment variable |

### Key rotation

| Key | Rotation procedure |
|---|---|
| `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 1. Set the new key and keep the old as `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`, 2. `POST /api/admin/key-rotation` until `GET` reports `previousKeyRetirable: true`, 3. Remove `_PREVIOUS`. Platform-admin-key gated. |
| `LOOKUP_HMAC_KEY` | A SEPARATE rotation — it moves lookup hashes, not ciphertext. 1. Set the new key, keep the old as `LOOKUP_HMAC_KEY_PREVIOUS`, 2. `POST /api/admin/lookup-rehash` until `GET` reports it retirable, 3. Remove `_PREVIOUS`. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` / `JWT_SECRET` | Set new value — existing sessions are invalidated |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Update in both Docker env and `.env.production` |

### Provider-specific secret storage

| Provider | Recommended |
|---|---|
| Railway | Railway environment variables (encrypted at rest) |
| Fly.io | `fly secrets set` (encrypted at rest, never in `fly.toml`) |
| Self-hosted | `.env.production` with `chmod 0600`, ideally backed by HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager |

## Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify encryption posture in each deployment environment.

### Application-layer encryption

- [ ] `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set (≥32 chars)
- [ ] User emails are encrypted in DB: `SELECT "emailEncrypted" FROM "User" LIMIT 1` returns ciphertext (not plaintext)
- [ ] Email lookup by hash works: `SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE "emailHash" = '<hash>'`
- [ ] Backfill complete: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User" WHERE "emailEncrypted" IS NULL` returns 0

### Transport encryption

- [ ] Application served over HTTPS
- [ ] HSTS header present
- [ ] Database connection uses SSL (if managed provider)

### Storage-at-rest encryption

**Railway**:
- [ ] PostgreSQL plugin dashboard shows encrypted volume
- [ ] S3/R2 bucket has default encryption enabled

**Fly.io**:
- [ ] `fly volumes list` shows encrypted volumes
- [ ] S3/R2 bucket has default encryption enabled

**Self-hosted**:
- [ ] `lsblk -f` shows LUKS type for Docker data partition
- [ ] `cryptsetup status <device>` confirms encryption active
- [ ] Docker named volumes reside on encrypted partition
- [ ] `.env.production` permissions: `ls -la .env.production` shows `rw-------`

### Backup encryption

- [ ] Database backups are GPG-encrypted before storage
- [ ] Upload backups are GPG-encrypted before storage
- [ ] Backup encryption keys stored separately from backups

### Soft-delete & retention

- [ ] Deleted records are soft-deleted (not hard-deleted)
- [ ] Purge job only removes records past grace period (90 days default)
- [ ] Audit events (`DATA_PURGED`, `DATA_EXPIRED`) are emitted on data lifecycle actions

## Data Classification Reference

| Classification | Examples | App-Layer Encrypted | At-Rest Encrypted |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PII** | User emails, names, contact info | ✅ AES-256-GCM | ✅ Volume/provider |
| **Sensitive** | Evidence content, policy text | ❌ (volume only) | ✅ Volume/provider |
| **Business** | Controls, risks, assets, tasks | ❌ | ✅ Volume/provider |
| **System** | Audit logs, sessions, tokens | ❌ | ✅ Volume/provider |

---

## Soft-Delete Model

### Protected entities (12 models)

| Model | deletedAt | deletedByUserId | retentionUntil |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asset | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Risk | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Control | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Evidence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Policy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vendor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| FileRecord | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Task | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Finding | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Audit | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| AuditCycle | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| AuditPack | ✅ | ✅ | — |

### Behavior

- **Default delete** → Sets `deletedAt = now()`, record remains in DB
- **Default reads** → Auto-filter `deletedAt IS NULL` via Prisma middleware
- **withDeleted()** → Opt-out of auto-filter for admin/recovery views
- **Hard delete** → Only via raw SQL (purge jobs), never via normal Prisma calls

### Non-protected entities (intentional hard-delete)

Junction/link tables (e.g., `riskControl`, `controlAsset`, `taskLink`, `vendorDocument`, `auditorPackAccess`) use hard-delete by design — they represent relationships, not business entities.

---

## Data Lifecycle (Purge Model)

```
Active → retentionUntil elapsed → runRetentionSweep → Soft-Deleted
                                                       ↓ 90+ days
                                                  purgeSoftDeletedOlderThan → Hard-Deleted

Evidence → retention elapsed → Archived (isArchived=true)
                                ↓ 365+ days
                           purgeExpiredEvidenceOlderThan → Hard-Deleted
```

| Job | Grace Period | Audit Event | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runRetentionSweep` | — | `DATA_EXPIRED` | Per-tenant |
| `purgeSoftDeletedOlderThan` | 90 days (default) | `DATA_PURGED` | Per-tenant, all 12 models |
| `purgeExpiredEvidenceOlderThan` | 365 days (default) | `DATA_PURGED` | Per-tenant |

All jobs support `dryRun: true` for preview without side effects.

---

## Cleanup Status

### Plaintext email lookups (dual-write)

The PII middleware maintains **dual-write**: both the original plaintext column (`email`) and the encrypted column (`emailEncrypted`) are populated on every write. This is a deliberate migration-period strategy.

**Current state**: Several code paths still use `where: { email: ... }` for lookups:

| File | Usage | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.ts` | OAuth sign-in callback, JWT enrichment | Low — dual-write ensures plaintext column is populated |
| `sso.ts` | Identity linking, SSO enforcement check | Low — same dual-write guarantee |
| `audit-readiness.ts` | Auditor invitation (compound unique) | Low — compound key `tenantId_email` |
| `audit-hardening.ts` | Auditor account lookup by email | Low — dual-write |
| `seed/route.ts` | Dev seed script lookup | None — dev-only path |

> [!NOTE]
> These plaintext lookups **work correctly** because the dual-write strategy ensures the `email` column is always populated alongside `emailEncrypted` and `emailHash`. Migration to `emailHash`-based lookups is a future optimization, not a security regression.

### Sensitive value logging

Full codebase scan confirms: **no PII values are logged**. All logger calls reference descriptive strings (e.g., "email permanently failed") rather than actual email addresses, names, or phone numbers.

### Delete flow verification

All 12 critical entity models are intercepted by `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS` in the soft-delete middleware. Hard-deletes only occur on junction/link tables (intentional) and via raw SQL in purge jobs (audited).

## Key Rotation & Future Work

### Key rotation caveats

1. **DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY rotation** runs through `POST /api/admin/key-rotation`, repeated until `GET` reports
   `previousKeyRetirable: true`. That flag is the condition for removing `_PREVIOUS`, and it is deliberately
   never true for a filtered (`?only=`) report — "these columns are done" is not "the deployment is done".
   The old `scripts/backfill-encryption.ts` this used to name was dead and is deleted; the route replaced it.
2. **LOOKUP_HMAC_KEY rotation is a different event** and needs `POST /api/admin/lookup-rehash`. A KEK rotation
   moves ciphertext and leaves hashes alone; a lookup rotation moves hashes and leaves ciphertext alone.
   Rotating one when you meant the other is the mistake the two separate routes exist to make harder.
3. During either rotation the previous key must stay set. **There is no plaintext fallback** — this document
   previously said the middleware's `decryptField` catch falls back to the plaintext column, which is
   backwards. For a `@map`'d field the plaintext column does not exist, and the catch replaces the value with
   **null** on purpose, so a renderer shows an empty field rather than `v1:base64…` as if it were a name
   (`pii-middleware.ts:143`). A row whose key is gone reads as absent, not as ciphertext, and not as plaintext.
3. **AUTH_SECRET** and **JWT_SECRET** rotation invalidates all existing sessions immediately — users must re-authenticate

### Future work (non-blocking)

| Item | Priority | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Migrate `where: { email }` to `emailHash` | Low | Convert remaining plaintext email lookups to use hash-based lookups; requires schema changes to make `emailHash` a unique index |
| Drop plaintext PII columns | Low | After all lookups use `emailHash`, the plaintext `email`/`name` columns can be made nullable or removed; requires coordinated migration |
| Cron scheduling for purge jobs | Medium | Wire `runRetentionSweep` and `purgeSoftDeletedOlderThan` into a job scheduler (cron, Railway scheduled tasks) |
| Multi-key envelope encryption | Low | Support key rotation without full re-encryption via envelope encryption (per-record DEK wrapped by KEK) |
| Evidence content encryption | Medium | Extend column encryption to evidence `content` field if requirements expand beyond volume-level protection |
